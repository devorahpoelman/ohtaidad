So i have this notebook since i started as freshman on my university. That´s 3 1/2 years ago. But lately i got big problems with my wifi adapter. For example: I´m in the library and all my devices like Phone/Tablet are having wifi. But my notebook either can´t connect or looses connection every 5 min or less. Have same issue at my dorm room. The only time where i have steady connection is using the LAN cable. I have already reinstalled the "Qualcomm Atheros AR9485WB-EG Driver" many times. help!!!! Здравствуйте, у меня стоит 8 винда.

My laptop (Asus A551L) has been crashing randomly for the past couple of months. It could crash while playing a game, using chrome, watching a movie (not online), using file explorer. The crashes seem completely random and not caused by a specific action . When it crashes the screen completely freezes, if sound was played, there will be a repetitive buzzing and even the caps lock and num lock buttons don't work. At first I thought it was caused by a virus, because I have downloaded Для скачивания регистрация на сайте не нужна!. позволяет запустить установку Windows XP SP3 Rus (ZverCD v.2013.3) как в ручном.

i have a asus ROG G75VW, seem to be lacking in the wifi dept. I am running a legit copy of win10. is it possible to change out the wifi card in this machine for a N or AC capable card? I have uninstalled the drivers and reinstalled them many times, and that doesnt work. win10 core i7 3610qm 2.3ghz 16gb ram nvidia 670m atheros AR9485wb-eg Hey all so I've been having this issue for quite some time, and after scouring the web I have found nothing to help me. I've updated my network card driver and I thought that it was fixed but it is now back to its old shenanigans. Essentially I'll be doing literally anything online and will get a "could not connect to webpage" message so when I go to my network list, it shows that it is disconnected from my network. I have tried to notice a pattern in which this occurs but there is seemingly. I have an Asus TP550L running Windows 10. My network adapter is a Qualcomm Atheros AR9485WB-EG. I have updated Windows and uninstalled/reinstalled driver, Windows troubleshooter says I am running the most recent update on the driver. Other devices and computers are able to use wireless so I know it is just this laptop having issues. When directly plugged into a Ethernet from my Hitron CGNM-2250 I have full connectivity and 177mbps which actually exceeds my 150 plan. Is there something I haven't. 
I've been noticing lately that my laptop hasn't been able to pick up wifi signals as good as before. I could be just two to three meters away from my router and it would be at best 2 to 3 bars with occasional single bars of wifi signal strength. I decided to update my wifi adapter (qualcomm atheros AR9485WB-EG) through atheros-drivers.com. The file I downloaded was a zip file and contained no .exe file. It only had a .cat, .sys, and .inf file. According to what I've read, if there isn't Fixes I have already tried: It was suggested that the laptop was over heating because of fans being clogged. I cleaned the fan filters and took a vacuum to all the vents. No air can was used because I do not have one available right now. This did not fix the problem. Reinstalling the drivers for the adapter does not work. The problem still happens even when using other people's wifi connections, so it is not just my router/modem. The issue will also occur when I download many files I have been given a laptop to repair two days ago, running on windows 7. Since it was bloated and unusable, I executed Tron (https://www.reddit.com/r/TronScript/). Happy of the results, I tried some of the manual tools, including NetAdapterRepair. But now, even if the wifi connects right, the dns server won't work (DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN in chrome). The strange thing is that I can use nslookup without errors, ping too. I can access cloudflare using the ip 198.41.213.157, where Okay, this problem is killing me. I am on about my third hour or so of troubleshooting and I am no closer to fixing the problem. Sony VAIO laptop Windows 7 upgraded to Windows 10 64 bit OS Qualcomm Atheros AR9485WB-EG Wireless Network Adapter Adapter is enabled Airplane mode off Wifi will not toggle to on; it automatically switches back to off as soon as I click it There was a known issue with some VPN during upgrade causing this problem. Microsoft provided instructions We have the xfinity modem/router combo, setup for two networks one on the 2.4GHz and one on the 5Ghz freq. iPhone and android on either network can get 50+ Mbps, my laptops don't even show the 5Ghz network, and on the 2.4GHz they struggle with 1 - 2 Mbps regularly. The signal is 5 bars on the network to all devices. I have updated the wifi adapter drivers on both laptops to the latest version. The more important and faster laptop on Win 7 has the Qualcomm Atheros QCA9565 802.11b/g/n. I have an ASUS laptop with a Qualcomm Atheros AR9485WB-EG Adapter. To put my opinion in the VERY nicest way possible, my WiFi experience has been extremely unsatisfactory , and I've narrowed down the causes of the problems (such as random connection loss several times a day) to likely being a bad WiFi adapter. What are some effective replacements for this card? Thanks in advance! P.S. All my drivers are up-to-date for Windows 10; no issues there, I'm fairly certain it's a hardware issue. I've run a speed test on an iphone and an ipad. My router broadcast at 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Both phone/tablet can connect to both and run at about 20 for 2.4GHz and 110 for 5GHz connections. As for the laptop. I'm running Windows 8.1 on a Samsung, model number NP355E5C. Wireless adapter is Qualcomm Atheros AR9485WB-EG Wireless Network Adapter. It claims to have the most updated drivers when I tried to update them. It is not able to find the 5GHz connection. Even the 2.4GHz connection is running. I'm trying to update the driver to my Qualcomm Atheros AR9485WB-EG Wireless Network Adapter since i've now realized i haven't updated since i bought my laptop in March of 2014. (Lenovo ideapad z510). But since i don't have much experience updating and installing drivers i've run into a few beginner concerns. I've searched online for how to install drivers but in doing I have run into more questions that have been harder to find the answer to. I've already downloaded the proper driver (https:/. I recently moved into a new apartment building that includes free apartment-wide wifi. The building is fairly small (about 20 units maybe?), and the caretaker is an older lady that has never owned a computer before and is completely unable to help. The building owner set up the wifi at some point and provides it for free, but as-is; there is no support for it, and no guarantees about connectivity or speed. We're just given the name and password for the network and that's it. Apparently. 
My mother has recently bought a new laptop, which I helped choose. After arrival, I made sure to uninstall most of the crapware that came bundled with it (which included Norton Antivirus), as well as install general use software. However, she uses torrents quite a lot, and ever since she started doing so in the new laptop, we've had a problem where a few seconds after the download starts, our router crashes and reboots, everyone in the house loses connection. Here goes the computer's specs. Hey there, everyone. So I've only managed to install Mac OS on one "hackintosh" before, which was rather unsuccessful, considering it often crashed, wifi never worked, video drivers were fault at best, etc. But now, I have an Intel and Nvidia-based laptop to work with. so my questions to you all are as follows: -What version of Mac OS would be best suited for my laptop? -Can I be linked to an install tutorial for that version? I've only done this once, remember. -Any extra commands I can find most networks no problem, but the high speed network which my phone pretty much instantly found cannot be found by Windows at all. Even inSSIDer can't find it. I have tried the classic "remove driver, reinstall driver" fix, but it did nothing but get messed up forcing me to switch harddrives (that or recovery, found swapping drives to be easier) . I'm guessing the network adapter itself is getting old, but doesn't feel like that's the reason. It's not crucial I'm on my laptop. Asus G75vw, 12GB RAM, i7-3610QM, Windows 7 64-Bit, Atheros ar9485wb-eg wireless network adapter. Generally at home I get between 25 and 40 Mbps down and 11 to 15 Mbps up. But after coming home yesterday it's been very very slow. I've been getting 0.72 to 1 Mbps up and 0.53 and below Mbps down. Last time this happened I went to the unofficial Atheros site and downloaded a different driver and I was good to go. This time I'm not so lucky, I've tried 5 different drivers I'm having a big problem with my iTunes. I'm trying to buy an album, and I keep getting the message that says something along the lines of "iTunes cannot connect to the store, the network connection was reset." I've messed around with my firewall more than I would've liked to in order to fix this issue. Can anyone help? I'm running Windows 8. EDIT: I ran iTunes Diagnostics and here are the results. Maybe they will help. Microsoft Windows 8 x64 Home Premium Edition (Build 9200) SAMSUNG ELECTR. 
A while back, I was having an issue where my laptop was the only device (out of 3 total Windows 10 systems) having issues with connecting to our home router. After some time, a new router (which didn't fix the problem), and a full reset of said new router, it seemed my problem was gone. Well, that was until tonight. Power outage happened, and suddenly I'm unable to connect to the router again, after months of zero issues. I've tried disabling my network adapter, restarting, and re-enabling. I just bought the ASUS ROG G551jm laptop a couple days ago. Its running on Windows 8. I've been checking my ping by running "ping www.google.ca -t" on "run". when i'm just watching videos or surfing the internet, the ping is around 30ms. but once i open a game like CS:GO or Dota 2, its spikes up to 1000ms or "Request timed out" Ohh. and i tried tabbing out of the games. and it goes back to low ping. but once i tab back in, it spikes again. Anyone know how i can fix this? EDIT: Since yesterday, I've had this issue twice. Basically, the WiFi randomly shuts off on my laptop (8.1) and will refuse to turn back on. What this means is that Windows will still act like it tries to enable WiFi, but always instantly disables it. I have tried disabling and reenabling the adapter, running Windows Troubleshooting, toggling Airplane Mode and testing to see if it effects Bluetooth as well (which it doesn't) and rebooting my PC (Which I rarely do as Hibernating is much more conveni. Okay, this problem is killing me.
