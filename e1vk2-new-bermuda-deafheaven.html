Don't want to spam so only posting part of my thoughts. Deafheaven stated that they did not want to make a Sunbather sequel and when they revealed their debut single, “Brought to the Water,” things were looking great in that regard. George Clarke’s growl has never been deeper or more aggressive. Kerry McCoy creates actual discernible riffs rather than the washed reverb sound that was characteristic of “Sunbather”. The thrash metal influence is obvious and the track ends with epic repetitive. Following Roads to Judah and Sunbather, New Bermuda was a surprise evolution in Deafheaven's sound. This definitely is no copy of their past albums, but it has all the Deafheaven elements plus heavier/trashier riffs. This year I decided to expand my musical horizons in a new way (for me) by ordering a bunch of albums that have got high scores on Pitchfork. Two of those were the ones mentioned in the title, and as a metal fan I ended up liking both of them. Stylistically, the two bands are actually quite different, so I guess what I'm actually looking for is recommendations for really good heavy music from the last couple of years. C'mon r/ifyoulikeblank, lets get metal.
